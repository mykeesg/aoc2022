# Advent of Code 2022 - Java solutions

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge in 2022.

This is not clean code, with minimal packaging, just to get the job done. Exceptions are not really handled, as the AoC input is always valid (unless the exercise specifically states that it is not).

I'm also using these exercises during my teaching, so there might be more comments in the code than actual statements. This could also mean that the solution used is not _"micro-optimized"_ to every last detail, as the goal is that juniors/beginners should also understand what's going on without some high-end mathematical magic that would just never come to their mind.

I will create a new class for each day, with a simple `Runnable` with try-catch included as base class.

Happy Coding!
